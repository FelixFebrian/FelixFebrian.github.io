> My life amounts to no more than one drop in a limitless ocean. Yet what is any ocean, but a multitude of drops?

I was born and raised in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. In 2014, I moved to Berlin, Germany to study at Technical University of Berlin. I received my bachelor degree in Chemical Engineering in September 2019 and at present I am in my master program Energy and Chemical Engineering (Energie- und Verfahrenstechnik).

I currently work as student assistant at the Chair of Chemical & Process Engineering, where I assist students and lead tutorial for the courses Heat and Mass Transfer II (Energie-, Impuls- und Stofftransport II), Process Engineering I (Verfahrenstechnik I), and Physical Chemistry (Physikalische Chemie).

In my second part-time job, I also do python programming for [SOPAT](https://sopat.de/), in which I work mainly with Django and Tensorflow.

<!-- As part of bachelor degree, my work for bachelor thesis and thus my current research interest is the study of hydromechanics in agitated vessel. -->
