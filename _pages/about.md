# About Me

I was born and raised in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. In 2014, I moved to Berlin, Germany to study at Technical University of Berlin. I currently work as student assistant at the Chair of Chemical & Process Engineering, where I assist students and lead tutorial for the courses "Energie-, Impuls- und Stofftransport II" (Heat and Mass Transfer), "Verfahrenstechnik I" (Process Engineering I), and "Physikalische Chemie" (Physical Chemistry).

As part of bachelor degree, my work for bachelor thesis and thus my current research interest is the study of hydromechanics in agitated vessel.
